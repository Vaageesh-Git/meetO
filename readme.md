meetO 
A full-stack social media platform built from the ground up using System Design principles, OOP concepts, Design Patterns, and SOLID principles.

Project Overview
meetO is a feature-rich social networking application that allows users to connect, share posts, follow each other, interact through comments and likes, send direct messages, and receive real-time notifications. The platform is designed with scalability, maintainability, and clean architecture at its core — making it a showcase of modern software engineering practices.

Setup & Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or above)
npm or yarn
MongoDB running locally (or a cloud instance)
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/Vaageesh-Git/meetO.git
cd meetO
2. Backend Setup
bash
cd backend
npm install
Create a .env file in /backend:
env
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUDINARY_URL=your_cloudinary_url   # or AWS config
Start the backend server:
bash
npm run dev
3. Frontend Setup
bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
The frontend will run at http://localhost:5173 and the backend at http://localhost:5000.
Note: The project is currently running locally. Deployment to a production environment is planned after Milestone 1 is complete.

Architecture Explanation
meetO follows a layered MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture with a clear separation of concerns:
Client (React) → Routes → Controllers → Services → Models → Database
Controllers handle HTTP requests and delegate to Services
Services contain core business logic
Models define data schemas and database interaction
Middleware handles auth guards, error handling, and request validation
Routes map API endpoints to their corresponding controllers
This structure ensures each layer has a single responsibility, making the system easy to test, extend, and maintain.

System Design Principles Applied
1. Scalability
Stateless REST API: The backend is stateless (JWT-based auth), making it horizontally scalable — you can spin up multiple server instances behind a load balancer without shared session state.
Feed Generation: The FeedController uses a fan-out or pull model to serve personalized feeds efficiently, avoiding full table scans.
Pagination: All list endpoints (feed, comments, notifications) are paginated to limit data transfer and database load.
2. Separation of Concerns
Each feature (Auth, Post, Comment, Follow, etc.) has its own dedicated Controller, Service, and Model — no cross-contamination of business logic.
3. Database Design (ER Model)
Normalized relational design with proper use of Primary Keys (PK) and Foreign Keys (FK) across all entities: User, Post, Comment, Like, Follow, Profile, Message, Notification.
Relationships are clearly mapped: User → Post (1:N), Post → Comment (1:N), User → Follow (M:N), User → Like (M:N).
4. Security
Passwords stored as hashed values (passwordHash field), never plain text
Auth middleware protects all private routes
Session tokens have expiry (expiry : DateTime in AuthService)

OOP Concepts Used
Concept
Where Applied
Encapsulation
Each class (User, Post, Comment, etc.) hides internal state and exposes only necessary methods
Abstraction
Services abstract database logic away from controllers; controllers don't know how data is fetched
Inheritance
Base controller/service classes define shared logic; specific controllers extend them
Polymorphism
Notification types (Like, Comment, Follow) handled polymorphically through a common sendNotification() interface


Design Patterns Implemented
1. Factory Pattern
Used in Notification creation: Instead of manually instantiating notification objects for each type (Like, Comment, Follow), a NotificationFactory creates the appropriate notification object based on the type. This decouples notification creation logic from the controller.
typescript
// Example concept
const notification = NotificationFactory.create(type, payload);
2. Observer Pattern
Used in the Feed & Notification system: When a user posts, likes, or follows, observers (subscribers) are notified and trigger feed updates or notification dispatch. This is implemented using an event-emitter pattern internally or via WebSocket broadcasts.
typescript
// Example concept
eventEmitter.emit('post:created', { userId, postId });
feedService.onPostCreated(handler);
notificationService.onPostCreated(handler);
3. Singleton Pattern
Used for Database connection and Auth service: A single instance of the DB connection pool and auth token manager is shared across the entire application, preventing redundant connections.
4. Middleware (Chain of Responsibility)
Express middleware stack acts as a chain — each request passes through authentication guards, validation, and error handlers before reaching a controller.

SOLID Principles
S — Single Responsibility Principle
Every class has one job:
AuthController only handles login/register/logout
FeedController only handles feed generation
NotificationService only manages notification dispatch
O — Open/Closed Principle
New notification types or post types can be added by extending existing classes/interfaces without modifying the core logic. The factory and observer patterns make this natural.
L — Liskov Substitution Principle
Any notification subtype (LikeNotification, CommentNotification, FollowNotification) can be used wherever a base Notification is expected without breaking the system.
I — Interface Segregation Principle
Controllers and services implement focused interfaces. For example, IFollowService only declares follow-related methods (follow, unfollow, isFollowing) rather than a bloated mega-interface.
D — Dependency Inversion Principle
Controllers depend on service interfaces, not concrete implementations. Services depend on repository/model abstractions, not directly on database drivers. This makes unit testing and swapping implementations easy.

UML Diagrams
Use Case Diagram
The single actor (User) interacts with the following use cases:
Authentication, Profile, Post, Comment, Like, Follow, Feed, Receive Notification, Message
Class Diagram
Key classes and their relationships:
User ↔ Profile (1:1)
User → Post (1:N)
Post → Comment (1:N)
Post → Like (1:N)
User → Follow (M:N self-referential)
User ↔ Message (M:N via senderId/receiverId)
User → Notification (1:N)
User → Feed (via FeedService)
AuthService handles session lifecycle
